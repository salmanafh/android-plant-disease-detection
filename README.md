# 🌱 Android Plant Disease Detection

An Android application that utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to quickly detect diseases in food crops. This project aims to assist farmers and agricultural researchers by providing an efficient mobile solution for plant disease identification.

## 📱 Features
- 📸 **Image-Based Detection** – Capture or upload plant images for disease classification.
- 🧠 **CNN Model Integration** – Uses a trained **machine learning model** for accurate predictions.
- ⚡ **Fast and Offline Detection** – Works seamlessly on Android devices.
- 📊 **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple and intuitive UI for ease of use.

## 🏗️ Installation
1. Download the latest APK: [`app-debug-androidTest.apk`](https://github.com/salmanafh/android-plant-disease-detection/blob/main/app-debug-androidTest.apk).
2. Install it on your Android device.
3. Open the app and start detecting plant diseases!

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Android Development** – Java/Kotlin, XML
- **Machine Learning** – TensorFlow Lite / PyTorch Mobile
- **Model** – Custom CNN trained for plant disease detection

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The user takes a photo or selects an image from the gallery.
2. The app processes the image using a **CNN model**.
3. The model predicts the disease and displays the result.
4. Can provide the treatment and care for predicted disease
